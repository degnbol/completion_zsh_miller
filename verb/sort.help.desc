Sorts records primarily by the first specified field, secondarily by the second
field, and so on.  (Any records not having all specified sort keys will appear
at the end of the output, in the order they were encountered, regardless of the
specified sort order.) The sort is stable: records that compare equal will sort
in the order they were encountered in the input record stream.
