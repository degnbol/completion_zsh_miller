Usage: ../c/mlr sec2gmtdate {comma-separated list of field names}
Replaces a numeric field representing seconds since the epoch with the
corresponding GMT year-month-day timestamp; leaves non-numbers as-is.
This is nothing more than a keystroke-saver for the sec2gmtdate function:
  ../c/mlr sec2gmtdate time1,time2
is the same as
  ../c/mlr put '$time1=sec2gmtdate($time1);$time2=sec2gmtdate($time2)'
