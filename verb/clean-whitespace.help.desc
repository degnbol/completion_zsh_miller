For each record, for each field in the record, whitespace-cleans the keys and/or
values. Whitespace-cleaning entails stripping leading and trailing whitespace,
and replacing multiple whitespace with singles. For finer-grained control,
please see the DSL functions lstrip, rstrip, strip, collapse_whitespace,
and clean_whitespace.
